<h2 style="text-align:center;">What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>

<p style ="color:darkblue;font-family:verdana;background-color:powderblue;">    Artificial intelligence  
is intelligence demonstrated by machines,in contrast to the natural intelligence
 displayed by humans and other animals.
 In computer science AI research is defined as the study of "intelligent agents":
 any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance
 of successfully achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" 
is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other 
human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving"</p>
